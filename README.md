# About Michael

A lover of language,
 a writer of words,
  a spinner of yarns.

A page, torn from a book.

---

I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; \
I lift my lids and all is born again. \
(I think I made you up inside my head.)

 â€”Sylvia Plath

## Observations

- There are only three optimizations: Do less. Do it less often. Do it faster.

  The largest gains come from 1, but we spend all our time on 3.
