# About Michael

A lover of language,
a writer of words,
a spinner of yarns,
and a mangler of bits.
A page, torn from a book.

My heart is a fish / hiding in the water-grass.

The largest gains come from 1, but we spend all our time on 3.

I am thinking it's a sign \
that the freckles in our eyes \
are mirror images, that when we kiss \
are perfectly aligned
